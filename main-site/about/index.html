            <p> Hello, my name is Brandon Brown.</p><br />

            <p>I am an electrical engineer turned full stack software developer with strengths in Ruby on Rails,
              JavaScript, React, Redux, Git, SQL, HTML, CSS, C#, and .NET. I have a passion for learning new
              technologies, solving complex problems, and collaborating with others.</p><br />

            <p>In December of 2014, I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a bachelor of science
              degree in Electrical Engineering. After graduation, I found myself working in as an industrial
              automation engineering consultant providing engineering and controls solutions to specialty chemical
              plants, distribution facilities, and paper mills.</p><br />

            <p>In my early professional years, I developed a passion for learning, writing, and debugging code. I
              spent
              many hours on YouTube watching tutorials (mostly C# at the time) and some more writing my own small
              applications. Thus, after 5 years working in the industrial automation industry, I decided to change my
              career focus to a software development role by enrolling in Flatiron School's Software Development
              Immersive.</p><br />

            <p>Since enrollment, I have created full stack web applications using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React,
              Redux, and more, and have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I am excited to see what the future
              holds, what more I can learn, and services that I can provide.</p><br />

            <p>I am currently looking for employment opportunities with a company that cares about and emphasizes
              continued learning, technical growth, and deep collaboration.</p>
